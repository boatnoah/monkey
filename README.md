# Python Interpreter Project

This repository contains my implementation of an interpreter in Python, inspired by the book "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball. While the original book uses Go, I've chosen to implement the interpreter in Python for personal preference and learning purposes.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into modules, each corresponding to a major component of the interpreter:

```
.
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
├── main.py
├── lexer
│   └── lexer.py
├── ast
│   └── ast.py
├── parser
│   └── parser.py
├── evaluator
│   └── evaluator.py
└── object
    └── object.py
```

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Lexer implementation
- [ ] Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) design
- [ ] Parser implementation
- [ ] Evaluator implementation


## Notes

I'll be updating this README and the project structure as I progress through the implementation. Each major milestone will be committed separately to track the evolution of the interpreter.

While this project is inspired by "Writing an Interpreter in Go", I'm adapting the concepts to Python, which may lead to some differences in implementation details.
